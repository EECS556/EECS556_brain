# Anatomical Models of 20 Normal Brains

------

This is a collection of 20 Anatomical Models of 20 Normal Brains from website:
http://brainweb.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/brainweb/

## Instruction from the website

> * Each anatomical model consists of a set of 3-dimensional "fuzzy" tissue membership volumes, one for each tissue class: Background, CSF, Gray Matter, White Matter, Fat, Muscle, Muscle/Skin, Skull, Blood vessels, Connective (region around fat), dura matter and bone marrow.
> * The voxel values in these volumes reflects the proportion of that tissue type present in that voxel, in the range [0,1]. In addition to the fuzzy tissue membership volumes, a discrete anatomical model is provided which consists of a class label (integer) at each voxel, representing the tissue which contributes the most to that voxel (0=Background, 1=CSF, 2=Gray Matter, 3=White Matter, 4=Fat, 5=Muscle, 6=Muscle/Skin, 7=Skull, 8=vessels, 9=around fat, 10 =dura matter, 11=bone marrow).
